# SidewinderX1FilamentGuide
A Filament Guide for the Artillery Sidewinder X1

This is a filament guide for those that don't feel like removing the original filament mount but want to move the filament off printer.  

You can buy any number of bearing spool holders to place on the table top, and you can use this to place in the free hole on the left side of the original spool holder to guide the filament into the runout sensor.  

You need an M4 screw and washer, that's it.  It works better if you already printed the spool holder roller (like on thingiverse by WeberCreativeCustoms).  

I placed the spool holder on the table perpendicular to the printer (but if you have space you can put it parallel behind it) and routed the filament up over the back roller, through this guide and then through the filament runout sensor.  It works great, and you can use PTFE tube (up to 5mm OD) to fit through this guide as well.
